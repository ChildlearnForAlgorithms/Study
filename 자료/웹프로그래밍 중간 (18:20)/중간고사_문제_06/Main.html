      <span>****</span> encourages the development of students’ individuality
      and builds their leadership character to make them highly capable people
      of the kind who can contribute to the development of Korea and the world.
      In the process, it never strays from its founding spirit of "truth, peace,
      and creation." <span>****</span> is also moving to establish its
      independence as a private school while never losing sight of its nature as
      a public educational institution. In addition, <span>****</span> seeks to
      differentiate itself from other institutions of higher education and
      maintain its distinctiveness, as manifested in its school name.
